# 🎓 Student Pass Predictor

This project uses a simple neural network built with **PyTorch** to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on:

- Study hours
- Attendance rate
- Previous grade

The model is trained on synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns, with added randomness to simulate noise and edge cases.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Realistic data generation using Gaussian distributions and thresholds  
- ✅ Binary classification using a feedforward neural network  
- ✅ K-Fold cross-validation with early stopping  
- ✅ Prediction with confidence and uncertainty estimation  
- ✅ Simple command-line interface for manual input
