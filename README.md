Student Pass or fail Predictor

This project uses a simple neural network built with **PyTorch** to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on:

- Study hours
- Attendance rate
- Previous grade
Features

-  Realistic data generation using Gaussian distributions and thresholds  
-  Binary classification using a feedforward neural network  
-  K-Fold cross-validation with early stopping  
-  Prediction with confidence and uncertainty estimation  
-  Simple command-line interface for manual input
